This will be my work-in-progress website that I will create adjacent to my learning with "The Odin Project" curriculum rather than their suggested "Recipes" website.
In addition to utilizing "TOP", I am utilizing ChatGPT, and will eventually add GitHub Copilot to also assist in the creation and my own education.
I plan on utilizing HTML, CSS, React, JS, and GSAP so far, but may add or remove depending on needs and complexity.
